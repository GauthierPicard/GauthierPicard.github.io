<blockquote><font size="-1">
This chapter introduces the ADELFE methodology, an agent-oriented methodology dedicated to the design of systems that are complex, open, and not well-specified. The need for its development is justified by the theoretical background given in the first section, which also gives an overview of the concepts on which multi-agent systems developed with ADELFE are based. A methodology is composed of a process, a notation, and tools. Tools are presented in the second section and the process in the third one, using an information system case study to better visualize how to apply this process.

This paper presents an approach based on cooperative self- organization for artificial systems, in order to tackle openness and dynamics. We propose to use cooperation as a local criterion enabling parts of the system --the cooperative agent-- to reorganize as to modify their interactions and then the global function. We underline the difficulty of defining cooperation and the means to reestablish a cooperative state within a non cooperative system. Two cooperative agents' behaviors are expounded, at the boundary between altruism and selfishness. This ap proach is also illustrated by modeling, from a local viewpoint, a classical constraint satisfaction problem: the N queens problem.

This paper highlights the benefits of using cooperation as the engine of adaptation and robustness for multi-agent systems. Our work is based on the AMAS (Adaptive Multi-Agent System) approach which considers cooperation as a self-organization mechanism to obtain adequate emergent global behaviors for systems coupled with complex and dynamic environments. A multi-robot resource transportation task illustrates the instantiation of a cooperative agent model equipped with both reactive and anticipative cooperation rules. Various experiments underline the relevance of this approach in difficult static or dynamic environments.

L'auto-organisation par coop&eacute;ration permet de concevoir des syst&egrave;mes multi-agents capables de r&eacute;agir et de s'adapter collectivement aux perturbations environnementales --ouverture et dynamique, par exemple. C'est une approche par recherche locale qui utilise la notion de coop&eacute;ration comme un crit&egrave;re local de r&eacute;organisation permettant aux parties --appel&eacute;es agents coop&eacute;ratifs-- de changer leurs interactions et leurs positions dans l'organisation.

Cooperation is a means for multi-agent systems to function more efficiently and more adaptively. Cooperation can be viewed as a local criterion for agents to self-organize and then to perform a more adequate collective function. This paper mainly aims at showing that with only local rules based on cooperative attitude and without any global knowledge, a solution is provided by the system and local changes lead to global reorganization.

 Techniques for Multi-Agent System Reorganization.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
A multi-agent system which operates in an open environment must be able to react to unpredictable events. These events lead, at the system level, to possible system's failures and, inside the system, to agents' failures. Each agent performs several roles which could be unfulfilled in the system in case of agents' failures. To overcome these failure situations, agents could have their interactions and/or roles change during the multi-agent system execution. Doing so, we can prevent from system incoherence and possible deadlocks. Hence, we propose in this paper two techniques such that the first techniques allows to operate changes in agents' interactions and the second technique allows to operate changes in agents' roles in order to build adaptive multi-agent systems. We will illustrate our techniques by applying them to a case study: a timetable design.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
This paper aims at explaining how to follow an agent-oriented process to develop a multi-agent mechanism design system. ADELFE methodology is devoted to adaptive multi-agent systems in which adaptation is enabled by cooperative self-organization. Two main works are emphasized. First, the analysis leads to the agent identification by studying the interactions both between the system and its environment and within the system itself. Second, the different modules of the agents and their cooperative attitude are modeled during the design phase. Such an approach is promising, but raises some difficulties considering the notion of cooperation, which is discussed before concluding.

 Cooperative Agent Model Instantiation to Collective Robotics in

<blockquote><font size="-1">
The general aim of our work is to provide tools, methods and models to adaptive multi-agent systems designers. These systems consist in several interacting agents and have to optimize problem solving in a dynamic environment. In this context, the ADELFE method, which is based on a self-organizing adaptive multi-agent system model, was developed. Cooperation is used as a local criterion to self-organize the collective in order to reach functional adequacy with the environment. One key stage during the design process is to instantiate a cooperative agent model that is an extension to classical reactive models in which cooperation subsumes any other nominal behavior. A sample implementation of the agent model in the collective robotics domain -- resource transportation -- will illustrate a discussion on the model.
