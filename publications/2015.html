<blockquote><font size="-1">
M2M systems are based on networks of sensors and actuators immersed in the physical world. They differ from classical information technology systems in many aspects. First, M2M devices are very constrained in terms of computing power, network and energy supply. Then, so-called &ldquo;vertical&rdquo; approaches (one stakeholder is involved from services to sensors) are very expensive. Thus, a growing trend emerges for so-called &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; architectures, where several stakeholders collaborate within the same infrastructure. Moreover, the growing number of connected devices raises the problem of scalability management.
Within, such governance infrastructure, a key issue is to install proper control and adaptation capabilities so that human intervention is minimized. Based on a Multi-Agent Oriented Programming (MAOP) approach, the agamemon system installs such capabilities by combining self-organization and reorganization mechanisms (so called self-reorganization), that will be the focus of this paper. We apply our approach to the SensCity project, which involves several stakeholders and we evaluate our approach experimentally by the means of simulations.

Decentralized energy production is meant to reduce generation and distribution inefficiencies, leading to major economic and environmental benefits. This new model is meant to be supported by smart grids, electricity networks that can intelligently integrate the actions of all users connected to them ---generators, consumers, and prosumers (those that do both)--- to efficiently deliver sustainable, economic and secure electricity supplies. A major research challenge is the design of markets for prosumers in smart grids that consider distribution grid constraints. Recently, a discrete market model has been presented that allows prosumers to trade electricity while satisfying the constraints of the grid. However, most of the times energy flow problems possess a continuous nature, and that discrete market model can only provide approximate solutions. In this paper we extend the market model to deal with continuous (piecewise linear) utility functions. We also provide a mapping that shows that the clearing of such a market can be done by means of integer linear programming.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is experiencing an increasing development of applications. Flexibility and genericity in the deployment and provisioning of context management solutions are key issues to be able to tackle with the large variety of domains of these context-aware applications. Existing proposals of Context Management Middleware (CMM) are still lacking such generic and flexible capabilities. To respond to these challenges, we propose CONSERT, a CMM, based on techniques and principles from the Semantic Web and Multi-Agent Systems domains. In this paper we focus on showing how the multi-agent architecture of this CMM provides the necessary flexibility to deploy different kinds of context provisioning patterns to address different AmI applications. We showcase the usage of our solution with a scenario from the domain of smart university life management.

A major research challenge is the design of markets for prosumers in smart grids that consider distribution grid constraints. In this paper we propose a novel market mechanism that allows prosumers to trade electricity while satisfying the constraints of the grid. Our market's allocation mechanism is implemented by means of the so-called RadPro, an efficient dynamic programming algorithm that assesses in polynomial time how much energy each prosumer trades as well as how energy must be distributed throughout the grid. Our empirical results show that RadPro significantly outperforms both CPLEX and Gurobi in solving time when computing the optimal allocation. Furthermore, the message-passing nature of RadPro offers the possibility of running our market in a decentralised (peer-to-peer) manner. Finally, we propose a payment rule that allows to cope with strategic behaviour.
