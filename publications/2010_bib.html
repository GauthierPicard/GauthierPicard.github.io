  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed increasing interest of people in creating, sharing, collaborating and socializing in many other different ways among new open and decentralized social structures called Virtual Communities (VC). They represent entities aggregation with common interests, goals, practices or values. VCs are particularly complex, uncertain and risky environments wherein trust became, rapidly, a prerequisite for the decision-making process. Within such context traditional techniques of establishing trust are regularly challenged and new trust models should be proposed in order to raise these new challenging issues.},

  abstract = {In the last years, the growing complexity of the current applications has led to the design of self-adapting systems presenting self-* properties. These systems are composed of several autonomous interactive entities. They behave autonomously and present enhanced characteristics allowing them to handle dynamics coming from exogenous and endogenous changes.

In this paper, we propose a set of criteria for the description and evaluation of the adaptive properties of such systems. They aim to provide a concrete mechanism to analyze the quality of the design of adaptive systems, to evaluate the effect of self-* properties on the performances and to compare the adaptive features of different systems. The criteria are grouped into different categories: methodological, architectural, intrinsic, and runtime evaluation. They have been identified and specified by analyzing several case studies, which address self-adaptivity issues through different approaches with different objectives in various application contexts.},
