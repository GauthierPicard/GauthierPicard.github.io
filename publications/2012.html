<blockquote><font size="-1">
Current IT applications are often meant to be used in complex and highly dynamic environments. Multi-Agent Oriented technologies and related programming languages offer high level abstractions that can ease the realisation of such applications. 
However, providing the means to handle adaptation and more particularly endogenous reorganisation, is still a challenging issue even if multiple state-of-the art works propose reorganisation models at the agent level. 
Adopting a multi-agent oriented approach, in this paper we define a dedicated set of artifacts (tools) that agents use to design and implement transitions to new organisations. The agents' compliance with a specific organisation specification that we formulate helps regulate and coordinate this reorganisation process. 
We show how this proposal has been realised within the JaCaMo multi-agent oriented programming platform and how this constitutes a step toward really adaptive systems.

Proposed in this paper is a multi-agent model that defines a set of global functioning rules for a flexible governance, adapted to parking management within a city. This is designed to aid drivers in finding a parking place, which satisfies a group of criteria, predefined in profiles, providing a better parking service to the public. The Multi-Agent model developed 
 is integrated in the platform SensCity, which is dedicated to the development and deployment of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) systems. 
The city is divided into a number of parking areas that are equipped with sensors and actuators, which are responsible for transferring data from and to the parking places. Therefore, the agents can work to interpret and manipulate the governance principles modeled and implemented by the multi-agent model, independently from drivers and parking spaces.  
Moreover, this paper proposes an intelligent end-to-end management of parking system using the MOISE organization framework.

 Surrogate-based agents for constrained optimization.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Multi-agent systems have been used to solve complex problems by decomposing problems into autonomous subtasks.  Drawing inspiration from multi-surrogate techniques, we have defined agents that employ different approximations of the data in subregions through the choice of surrogate, or meta-model, which created surrogate-based agents.  In this article, we explored a method of design space partitioning that assigned agents to subregions of the design space, which drove the agents to locate optima through a mixture of optimization and exploration in the subregions.  These methods were illustrated on two constrained optimization problems, one with uncertainty and another with small, disconnected feasible regions.  It was observed that using a system of surrogate-based agents was more effective at locating the optimum compared to optimization with a single surrogate over the entire design space.

Machine-to-Machine (M2M) systems compose smart networks of multiple
  devices sensing or acting in the physical world, and interacting together
  to provide data to added value services.  
  The M2M infrastructures aiming at being deployed at city scale are faced to
  the scaling in the number of services and applications they have to support.
  A dynamic sharing of M2M infrastructure between applications is thus a strong
  requirement.  
  In this paper, we propose to use multi-agent abstractions and related
  programming languages to define an adaptive and agile layer to govern M2M
  infrastructure to support different applications.  
  We illustrate this approach with a smart parking management application.

 An adaptive and socially-compliant trust management system for

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Virtual communities (VCs) are open socio-technical structures wherein autonomous entities (i.e. agents) with common objectives join together to mutually satisfy their goals. The success of these communities relies on collaboration and resource sharing principals, making trust a critical issue for each member. Such environments motivate the need for more flexible trust models wherein both individual (i.e. user-centred) and collective (i.e. community-centred) trust requirements are considered in the decision making-process. <p>
This paper reports our on-going efforts in that perspective and presents our Adaptive and Socially-Compliant Trust Management System (ASC-TMS). Policies are used, in the system, to specify individual and collective trust requirements, while meta-policies enable agents to dynamically adapt their policies and make socially-compliant trust decisions through automatic combination of individual and collective policies.
